	 <h2>Demolitions by Community District, 2007 to 2017</h2>

<article><p>Almost 2,500 buildings were demolished in Manhattan in the last decade, according to permit data from NYC Department of Buildings. The highest numbers of demolitions – almost half of the total - occurred in Midtown, followed by Lower Manhattan.</p>  

	<p>The number of demolition permits issued does not equal the exact number of buildings demolished. The permit data includes ‘renewals’ as well as ‘initial’ permits, meaning a specific permit may have been counted twice. Also, a building owner granted a permit may not ultimately follow through with actual demolition.</p>  </article>

<p>Nonetheless, demolition is generally the first step towards new construction and therefore provides a clue to redevelopment trends in already built-out urban areas. Consistent with its use as an indicator of new construction activity, the numbers of demolition permits dropped significantly with the 2008 economic crash before peaking again around 2015.</p>  </article>

<p>The replacement of old structures with new ones does not necessarily increase population density or number of overall housing units but does tend to increase neighborhood property values. Further research is needed to determine how total housing units and property values were actually affected in specific neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The type of buildings demolished presents another interesting question – many buildings have cultural, historic, and sentimental value apart from their objective monetary value, although this is harder to quantify.  A survey of the architectural character and age of buildings demolished in the last decade, as well as data about the type and size of new buildings, would reveal more about the nature of the change to a specific community.  </p></article>
